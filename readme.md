A lfi brute forcer intended for ctf competitions such as hackthebox

This script takes input of a url with the lfi injection in there pointed to the /proc directory and
spits out any details associated with processes to a txt file.

Eventually I want to add hyper threading to it to make it go faster, but there would have to be a time 
implementation to avoid any accidental ddosing.

The script can be used by just running it and pointing it at the target website directory.

ONLY FOR CTF USE
